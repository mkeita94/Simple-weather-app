# Simple-weather-app
This is a simple weather web app that allows users to see the weather for the current.
Additionally, users can select their preferences by clicking on cold, warm, or hot options.
Each day is represented as an object of a class called weatherComponent.
Each object has four properties, such as day, temperature, weatherCondition, and pollenCount.
Images are loaded dynamically based on the weatherCondition.
